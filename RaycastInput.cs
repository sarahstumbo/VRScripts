//This script handles raycasting from the main camera into the scene. It is also responsible for knowing what the user is
//looking at and telling the interactable objects what the player is doing (looking at them, looking away, clicking them, and 
//releasing them). The script acheives this by simulating a tradition input using a raycast and then sending it to the event system
//as if it were a real input event
